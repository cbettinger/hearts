		<h1>Hearts</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">Christian Bettinger</p>
		<section>
			<p>Hearts is a <a href="#rules">simple and beginner-friendly</a> yet <a href="#strategy">challenging</a> trick-avoiding card game for two to six players. The basic object is to take as few points as possible, where Hearts and the Queen of Spades score.</p>
			<p>This page covers a rather modern variant of the Hearts-type family of card games, which often is called <i>Black Lady</i> or <a href="#americanhearts"><i>American Hearts</i></a>. Certainly also due to the fact that Microsoft has delivered a popular implementation of this modern variant under the name <i>Hearts</i> in many versions of its Windows operating system, many people (including me) refer to this variant when they talk about <i>Hearts</i>. The preceeding variant, in which the Queen of Spades does not score, is therefore referred to as <a href="#originalhearts"><i>Original Hearts</i></a>.</p>

			<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
			<p>Hearts is a fourâ€‘handed card game played with a standard 52 card deck with the cards ranking from Ace (high) down to 2 (low). Variations for 2, 3, 5 and 6 players are described <a href="#variations_players">below</a>.</p>
			<p>The objective is to avoid taking tricks that contain points. The game ends when some player reaches or exceeds 100 points. The winner is the player with the lowest score.</p>
			<h3>Dealing</h3>
			<p>Choose a dealer. The deck is shuffled by the dealer, cut by the player to his right and dealt clockwise face-down, beginning with the player to his left, until each player has 13 cards.</p>
			<h3>Passing</h3>
			<p>After each deal, players select and simultaneously pass any three cards face-down to another player. On the first hand, cards are passed to the player on left. On the second hand, cards are passed to the player on right. On the third hand, cards are passed to the player sitting opposite. On the fourth hand, no cards are passed at all. Repeat.</p>
			<h3>Playing</h3>
			<p>The player holding the 2 of Clubs must lead it to the first trick. The other players take their turn clockwise.</p>
			<p>Each player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void in the led suit, a card of any other suit may be discarded. However, if a player cannot follow suit in the first trick, the Heart and the Queen of Spades must not be discarded. The player with the highest card of the led suit takes the trick and leads the next one.</p>
			<p>Hearts must not be led until a Heart or the Queen of Spades has been discarded (a.k.a. <i>Breaking the Hearts</i>). A player whose hand consists entirely of Hearts may lead any Heart. The Queen of Spades may be led at any time.</p>
			<h3>Scoring</h3>
			<p>After each hand, players count the number of points they have taken. Each Heart counts 1 point, the Queen of Spades counts 13 points.</p>
			<p>If a player took all 13 Hearts and the Queen of Spades (a.k.a. <i>Shooting the Moon</i>), he scores 0 points and each other player 26 points.</p>

			<h2>Common Rule Variations</h2>
			<h3 id="variations_players">Number of Players</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>2 players: The deck is dealt into four hands, face-down. Each player takes two and selects one of them to start with. Three cards are passed before playing each hand. On the first trick, both players play their lowest Club (or any card if there is no Club). Breaking the Hearts in the first hand does not carry over into the second hand. Players score only after the second hand.</li>
				<li>2 players: 3's, 5's, 7's, 9's, Jacks and Kings are removed from the deck, leaving 13 cards to be dealt to each player.</li>
				<li>3 players: 2 of Diamonds is removed and each player gets 17 cards.</li>
				<li>5 players: 2 of Diamonds and 2 of Clubs are removed and each player gets 10 cards. The player with the 3 of Clubs must lead it to the first trick.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Passing</h3>
			<h3>Playing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Queen of Spades does not break Hearts.</li>
				<li>The Queen of Spades must be discarded at the first opportunity.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Strategy</h2>
			<p>As in many card games, try to remember the cards that have already been played. Pay attention to what cards you are passed to guess the other's strategy.</p>
			<h3>Basic</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Passing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pass high cards, especially Aces and Kings.</li>
					<li>Do not pass Spades lower than the Queen.</li>
					<li>If you do not have enough Spades lower than the Queen to protect her, pass the Queen of Spades.</li>
					<li>Do not pass low Hearts.</li>
					<li>Do not pass your last Club.</li>
					<li>If you want to lead the second trick with a specific suite, do not pass the Ace of Clubs.</li>
					<li>If you want to lead the second trick with a specific suite, pass the 2 of Clubs.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Playing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Do not hesitate to take a trick with no scoring card, especially if you want to lead the next trick with a specific suite.</li>
					<li>If the trick contains scoring cards, play the highest card that will not take the trick.</li>
					<li>If you have to take a trick, play your highest card.</li>
					<li>Void Clubs and Diamonds as soon as possible.</li>
					<li>If you have a void in the led suite, play your most dangerous card.</li>
					<li>If you do not have Spades higher than the Queen, lead Spades to force others to play the Queen of Spades (a.k.a. <i>Bleeding out Spades</i> or <i>Smoking out the Queen</i>).</li>
					<li>Do not lead with an Ace (unless the Queen of Spades has already been played).</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>Advanced</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Passing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep at least one high Heart (at best the Ace) to prevent others from <i>Shooting the Moon</i>.</li>
					<li>Do not pass Spades at all.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
